Repository for paper II DCO





The simulations are given on Zenodo: 


An overview of the simulations and number of BHBH, BHNS and NSNS mergers in each zenodo file can be found here:

The fiducial COMPAS simulation settings are summarized in [Broekgaarden et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210302608B/abstract) and a summary table can be found [here (PDF)](https://github.com/FloorBroekgaarden/Double-Compact-Object-Mergers/blob/main/otherFiles/Table_with_detailed_binary__population_synthesis_simulation_settings.pdf)
and a preview of the PDF is added here as png:
